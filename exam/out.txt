The interpolated value at a random location between 0 and 10
The function is cos(x)*sin(y)

Interpolated value of point p(8.28685, 74.2971) is: 0.43113
While the nearby values are: 0.4913, 0.4575, 0.313 and 0.2914 

Check the plot for interpolated values in a nice colormapped plot


If you wish to change the function, go to the main.py file and change the 'func1' to func2 or 3
