The interpolated value at a random location between 0 and 10
The function is cos(x)*sin(y)

Interpolated value of point p(2.48367, 9.99331) is: 0.98408
While the nearby values are: 0.9329, 0.9776, 0.9463 and 0.9916 

Check the plot for interpolated values in a nice colormapped plot


If you wish to change the function, go to the main.py file and change the 'func1' to func2 or 3
