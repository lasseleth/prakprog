The interpolated value at a random location between 0 and 10
The function is the Rosenbrock function, (1-x)^2+100*(y-x^2)^2

Interpolated value of point p(56.6003, 77.5855) is: 1309.8
While the nearby values are: 1468, 1627, 1063 and 1199 

Check the plot for interpolated values in a nice colormapped plot


If you wish to change the function, go to the main.py file and change the 'func1' to func2 or 3
