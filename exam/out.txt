The interpolated value at a random location between 0 and 10
The function is cos(x)*sin(y)

Interpolated value of point p(2.03919, 18.3458) is: 0.010497
While the nearby values are: 0.07919, -0.1195, 0.08033 and -0.1212 

Check the plot for interpolated values in a nice colormapped plot


If you wish to change the function, go to the main.py file and change the 'func1' to func2 or 3
