First doing multi-threaded processing using pthreads.

Using two threads, pi has been estimated by throwing a total of 1e+08 darts at a 1x1 square with a r=0.5 circle inscribed inside.
The estimated pi is pi=3.14167


Now doing the same but with the OpenMP protocols instead.

In total, 1e+08 darts were thrown using OpenMP multi-threading.
Pi was estimated to be pi=3.1416.
