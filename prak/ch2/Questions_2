What is compilation and linking (of a C-program)? What is source code, object code, executable code?


How can you compile and link a C-program which is wholly contained in one file, say hello.c? How do you run the resulting executable code?


How do you supply the compiler with the description of the printf function? Why do you need to do this? How do you link the printf function?

In order to use the C mathematical functions, do you need to include any header files? Link any library? Hint: man sin.
One needs to include this line for regualr math: "#include<math.h>", and the link should be established (how?)
For complex numbers, also use "#include<complex.h>"


What is tgmath.h? If you use tgmath.h do you need to link any library?
"type generic math", it is basically the a combination of the two libraries "math.h" and "complex.h", and can figure out the type of the input, and use the appropriate function needed.
